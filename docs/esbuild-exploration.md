# Using esbuild As Your New Bundler

Published on March 8, 2021

You might have heard about [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) before even reading this post. If you did, that's great! But if you never heard about it before this, or at least you haven't tried it, then **you should!**

You can make esbuild to become either a bundler, or just simply use it as a compiler in replacement of babel.

## As Babel replacement, seriously?

We all know about babel, how powerful babel is, and how babel has helped us building great stuffs all around the web. But in for large scale project, you might have experienced that the build time takes very long! This might become one of the biggest productivity blocker.

Babel simply has more overhead cost than esbuild. Even if you cache the loader, esbuild is much much faster. Although, esbuild even put [restriction](https://esbuild.github.io/plugins/#plugin-api-limitations) for when writing plugin, so you might want to know this before really replacing babel, especially if you depend on specific babel plugins that is not present in esbuild.

Let us talk about how to replace babel with esbuild. But before this, you should know that babel can simply take a folder as entry points, but in esbuild you need to **specify** all the file paths that you are going to compile as an array of paths.

I suggest you to start from using **Typescript** because esbuild supports typescript natively, without adding new plugin. Therefore, I can say that probably it doesn't have any performance impact when you are compiling typescript or normal javascript files, unlike Babel.

If you are using typescript, you can get the list of needed files by using this method:

```js
// getTSConfig.js

const ts = require('typescript');

function getTSConfig(configPath = 'tsconfig.json') {
  const tsConfigFile = ts.findConfigFile(process.cwd(), ts.sys.fileExists, configPath);

  if (!tsConfigFile) {
    throw new Error(`tsconfig.json does not exist in the current directory: ${process.cwd()}`);
  }

  const configFile = ts.readConfigFile(tsConfigFile, ts.sys.readFile);

  if (configFile.error) {
    throw new Error(`Cannot read TS configuration file from ${process.cwd()}: ${configFile.error}`);
  }

  const tsConfig = ts.parseJsonConfigFileContent(configFile.config, ts.sys, process.cwd());

  return { tsConfig, tsConfigFile };
}

module.exports = getTSConfig;
```

Now, let's pair it together with esbuild:

```js
const { startService } = require('esbuild');
const getTSConfig = require('./getTSConfig');

async function build() {
  const { tsConfig, tsConfigFile } = getTSConfig();
  const service = await startService();

  const options = {
    color: true,
    entryPoints: tsConfig.fileNames,
    outdir: OUT_DIR,
    loader: {
      '.js': 'jsx', // if you are also compiling react files
    },
    format: 'esm',
    target: 'es2015',
    minify: false,
    tsconfig: tsConfigFile,
    plugins: [], // optional
  };

  try {
    await service.build(options);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } finally {
    service.stop();
  }
}
```

### What about compiling file assets?

Using the configuration above, esbuild will skip to try compile every files with extension that typescript unable to read. That means, if you are importing images in your js/ts files, they won't be exported in the out directory.

Fortunately, here is a piece of code you might want to consider adding **after the build process is finished**:

```js
async function build() {
  ...

  try {
    const cpy = require('cpy');
    const relativeOutDir = path.relative(SRC_DIR, OUT_DIR);

    await cpy(['**', `!**/*.{js,ts,jx,tsx}`], relativeOutDir, {
      cwd: SRC_DIR,
      parents: true,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

**And you're done!**

If you are curious about the timing, try logging the time before & after each processes (build & copy).

## Using together with existing bundler

If you are using webpack, I suggest you to have a look into [esbuild-loader](https://github.com/privatenumber/esbuild-loader).

If you are using rollup, there is also existing [plugin](https://github.com/egoist/rollup-plugin-esbuild) to pair with esbuild. You can refer to the [full configuration](https://github.com/josteph/elastic-node-example/blob/main/rollup.config.js) I have tried before writing this post.

There is not much to be explained, but simply follow the instructions given in their README.

## Conclusion

It is not easy to fully migrate from existing build tools, there are also many unexplained limitations of esbuild in this blog. Although, you may find several testimonies about the significant speed improvements [here](https://github.com/privatenumber/esbuild-loader/issues/13).

If you are not convinced yet, just give it a try ðŸ˜‰
